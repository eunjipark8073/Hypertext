  <p><h2>Genre2-fiction</h2></<p> For those who were children in the early 1990’s the principle behind hypertext fiction will not seem new. Instead, it will serve as a reminder of the "Choose Your Own Adventure" book series. Hypertext fiction is a collective effort between reader and writer, where the writer provides interlaced web pages of text and the reader decides what order to read the pages. In some hypertext works, readers can even add their own work to the fiction and change the plot.<br><br>
  <h3><a href="http://unknownhypertext.com/" target="_blank">The Unknown by Scott Rettberg, William Gillespie, Dirk Stratton and Frank Marquardt</a></h2>

  <p>One of the most ambitious, weird and exciting works of e-literature, The Unknown makes use of texts fictional, real, obnoxious and funny to create a sprawling world that’s as exciting as it is confusing. Though the story is hard to follow, the writing pushes you through.(www.dazeddigital.com)</p><br><br>
