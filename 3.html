<p><h2>Genre2 fiction</h2></<p> For those who were children in the early 1990â€™s the principle behind hypertext fiction will not seem new. Instead, it will serve as a reminder of the "Choose Your Own Adventure" book series. Hypertext fiction is a collective effort between reader and writer, where the writer provides interlaced web pages of text and the reader decides what order to read the pages. In some hypertext works, readers can even add their own work to the fiction and change the plot.<br><br><br>
