<h2>Genre1-poetry</h2>
<strong>Hypertext<u>"poetry"</u></strong> can consist of words, although not necessarily organized into lines and stanzas, as well as, sounds, visual images, movement or other special effects. Although the poem may dazzling with sounds, perhaps of a lawnmower, while the words "mowing," "stop," "Sunday," and "morning" float across your computer screen in pseudo-three dimensional letters, one will have be hard pressed to identify the use of any formal poetics. There are an infinite number of new and unusual effects that can be superimposed on text to create a hypertext poem, but below are some examples of types of "clickable" poems.
