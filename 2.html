<h2>Genre1-poetry</h2>
  <strong>Hypertext<u> poetry</u></strong> can consist of words, although not
  necessarily organized into lines and stanzas, as well as, sounds, visual images,
  movement or other special effects. Although the poem may dazzling with sounds,
  perhaps of a lawnmower, while the words "mowing," "stop," "Sunday," and "morning"
  float across your computer screen in pseudo-three dimensional letters, one will
  have be hard pressed to identify the use of any formal poetics. There are an
  infinite number of new and unusual effects that can be superimposed on text to
  create a hypertext poem, but below are some examples of types of "clickable" poems.

  <i>I very much enjoyed the process of working on this assignment, as it provided
     an opportunity to try something different and new. My hypertext writing is in
     the form of poetry, so in prefacing my project I should say that I have never
     before written poetry (at least that I can remember), and have never written
     anything specifically for hypertext. The feeling of inexperience with both the
    medium and the mode of expression was a bit daunting at first, but I did not want
    to miss the opportunity to try something novel,and so decided upon hypertext poetry.
    My project takes on a simple structure with fairly short rhymed poems, in which particular
    words or concepts within the poems are links to other titles.</i></p>
